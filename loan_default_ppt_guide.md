# Loan Default Prediction - PPT Presentation Guide

Here's a comprehensive explanation guide for each section of your presentation, structured as Q&A format for easy reference during your presentation.

## **SLIDE 1: Problem Statement & Business Context**

### **What is the core problem we're solving?**
"Traditional risk assessment methods in financial institutions rely heavily on basic metrics like credit scores, income, and collateral. However, these methods are missing **complex patterns and relationships** in borrower data, leading to:
- Substantial financial losses from unexpected defaults
- Inefficient credit scoring that doesn't capture the full risk profile
- Need for advanced ML approaches to identify hidden risk factors"

### **Why is this important for the business?**
"Loan defaults can cost financial institutions millions of dollars annually. Our dataset shows an 8.08% default rate across 121,856 applications. Even a 1% improvement in default prediction accuracy can save millions in prevented losses while maintaining healthy loan approval rates."

### **What makes this a machine learning problem?**
"The relationships between borrower characteristics and default risk are non-linear and complex. For example, the combination of age, employment history, and debt-to-income ratio creates intricate patterns that traditional rule-based systems cannot capture effectively."

## **SLIDE 2: Dataset Overview & Key Challenges**

### **Tell me about the dataset characteristics:**
"Our dataset contains:
- **121,856 loan applications** - substantial sample size for robust modeling
- **40 features** covering demographics, financial status, employment, and credit history
- **Binary target**: Default (1) vs Non-Default (0)
- **8.08% default rate** creating a significant class imbalance challenge"

### **What were the main data quality challenges?**
"We identified three critical challenges:
1. **Class Imbalance (11.4:1 ratio)** - Risk of model bias toward majority class
2. **Missing Values in 33 columns** - Required sophisticated imputation strategies
3. **Outliers across multiple features** - Could skew model performance"

### **How did these challenges impact your approach?**
"Each challenge required specific techniques:
- **Imbalance**: Tested multiple resampling methods (SMOTE, BorderlineSMOTE, ADASYN)
- **Missing values**: Tiered approach based on missingness percentage
- **Outliers**: IQR-based detection and clipping to maintain data integrity"

---

## **SLIDE 3: EDA & Data Preprocessing**

### **What were your key discoveries during EDA?**
"We uncovered several critical risk patterns:
- **Age Factor**: 35-45 age group shows highest default rates - likely due to major life expenses
- **Financial Stress**: Debt-to-income ratio >40% increases default risk by 3x
- **Employment Stability**: <1 year tenure increases default probability by 2.5x
- **Asset Ownership**: No assets correlates with 1.8x higher risk"

### **Explain your missing value treatment strategy:**
"We implemented a **tiered imputation approach**:
- **High missing (>50%)**: Created indicator variables + domain-specific imputation
- **Medium missing (15-50%)**: Smart imputation using business logic
- **Low missing (<15%)**: KNN imputation for numerical, mode for categorical
- **Result**: Zero missing values in final dataset while preserving information"

### **How did you handle outliers?**
"Used **IQR-based detection and clipping**:
- Identified outliers beyond 1.5 Ã— IQR from Q1/Q3
- Clipped extreme values rather than removing them to preserve sample size
- Treated 14 features with significant outlier presence
- **Impact**: Improved model stability and performance"

## **SLIDE 4: Feature Engineering Strategy**

### **What new features did you create and why?**
"We engineered 8 domain-specific features with clear business logic:

1. **Debt_to_Income_Ratio (18.2% importance)**: Primary financial stress indicator
2. **Employment_Years (14.7% importance)**: Job stability predictor
3. **Age_Years (12.3% importance)**: Life stage categorization
4. **Income_per_Family_Member (9.8% importance)**: Family financial pressure indicator"

### **How do these features translate to business value?**
"Each feature directly supports underwriting decisions:
- **Debt_to_Income > 40%**: Automatic flag for manual review
- **Employment_Years < 1**: Higher scrutiny of income stability
- **Age categories**: Risk-adjusted pricing by life stage
- **Family burden**: Assessment of disposable income reality"

### **What was your feature importance methodology?**
"We used **multiple importance techniques**:
- **Model-based importance**: From XGBoost feature_importances_
- **Permutation importance**: More robust, measures actual predictive impact
- **Business validation**: Ensured features align with domain knowledge"

---

## **SLIDE 5: Handling Imbalanced Dataset**

### **Why is class imbalance a critical issue here?**
"With 91.92% non-defaults vs 8.08% defaults, models naturally bias toward predicting 'no default' to achieve high accuracy. This creates **high false negative rates** - we miss actual defaults, which is financially catastrophic."

### **How did you compare different techniques?**
"We tested 4 resampling techniques with cross-validation:
- **SMOTE**: +12% recall improvement, balanced precision impact
- **BorderlineSMOTE**: +8% recall, +5% precision - focuses on borderline cases
- **ADASYN**: +10% recall, adaptive synthetic sampling
- **Random Undersampling**: +15% recall but -10% precision loss"

### **Why did you choose SMOTE?**
"SMOTE provided the **best balance**:
- **50% sampling strategy**: Created balanced training set without extreme oversampling
- **Maintained precision**: Avoided excessive false alarms
- **Business impact**: Catches more defaults while preserving customer trust through controlled false positive rates"

## **SLIDE 6: Modeling & Results**

### **Walk me through your model selection process:**
"We compared 4 algorithms with 5-fold cross-validation:

1. **XGBoost (Selected)**: 75.2% AUC - Best overall discrimination
2. **Random Forest**: 74.2% AUC - Good recall balance
3. **Extra Trees**: 73.1% AUC - High recall but lower precision
4. **Logistic Regression**: 64.1% AUC - Baseline performance"

### **Why did XGBoost win?**
"XGBoost excelled because:
- **Highest AUC (75.2%)**: Best ability to distinguish between classes
- **Gradient boosting**: Effective for imbalanced datasets
- **Feature importance**: Provides clear business insights
- **Robust performance**: Consistent across all CV folds"

### **Interpret your final test performance:**
"Our test results show a **conservative, high-precision model**:
- **AUC 73.04%**: Good discrimination power
- **Precision 36.8%**: When we flag a default, we're right 1 in 3 times
- **Recall 5.03%**: We catch 1 in 20 actual defaults
- **Business logic**: Prioritizes avoiding false alarms over catching every default"
